    This option will encrypt the current message, using PGP and the recipients personal public key, and then send it. You MUST have the public key of the recipient stored in your addressbook or else this option will fail. If you have the public key for the recipient in your addressbook and are still receiving errors, verify that the e-mail address in the recipient field matches the e-mail address where the public key is stored. The encrypted data will be attached to the outgoing message.

    <para>
    This option will digitally sign the current message using PGP and your personal private key. If you have not already entered the passphrase for your private key during this session you will be prompted for it. The recipient must have a copy of your public key to digitally verify your signature.

    <title>Preferences: Request Delivery Confirmation</title>
    <para>
    "Request Delivery Confirmation" sends a request to the recipient's e-mail server to notify you when it has delivered the message to the recipient's mailbox. It doesn't mean the message has been seen, just that it's sitting in a mailbox somewhere. Not all mail servers support this.

    <title>Preferences: Delete Spam After Reporting</title>
    <para>
    You may elect to do one of three items after reporting a message as either spam or innocent.
    </para>
    <para>
    First, you can decide to do nothing - the message will be reported as either spam or innocent but will otherwise remain unchanged in your mailbox.
    </para>
    <para>
    Second, if reporting a message as spam, you can instead have the message be immediately deleted.  This setting has no effect on reporting a message as innocent.
    </para>
    <para>
    Third, after reporting a message as spam the message will be deleted from the current mailbox and moved to your spam folder.  Alternatively, if reporting a message as innocent the message will be deleted from the current mailbox and moved to your INBOX.

    <title>Virtual Folders: Virtual Inbox</title>
    <para>
    Virutal Inbox is a saved search that does away with the need to search every mailbox for messages marked as new.  Instead, all currently subscribed mailboxes are searched for new messages and the results are displayed in a single mailbox.
    </para>

<entry id="virtual_trash" state="new">
    <title>Virtual Folders: Virtual Trash</title>
    <para>
    Virtual Trash is a saved search that does away with the need for a separate Trash folder.  Instead of moving messages to a centralized trash folder, messages are simply marked as deleted in the current folder they live in.  When 'show deleted messages' is turned off, this results in these messages not appearing in a mailbox view.  When a user clicks on Virtual Trash, *all* mailboxes all searched for messages that are flagged deleted and these messages are displayed in a single mailbox.
