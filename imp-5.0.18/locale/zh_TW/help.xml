    輸入郵件的主旨。
    你所輸入的主旨將成為送出郵件的"主旨:"。
    盡可能以簡單扼要的描述來說明主旨。
    主旨是最容易讓人能夠在日後回想起這封郵件內容的方法，
    因此在編寫郵件時主旨是相當重要的。
    而且，當你'回覆'或'轉寄'郵件時主旨也將會一併放進新郵件中，
    如此一來郵件之間才能型成一種關聯。
    然而，如果你對'回覆'或'轉寄'的郵件內容中做了些許的改變，
    或許你可以考慮在'主旨'上增加簡單的變動通知，
    如此所有的收信對象才能繼續依循此一"關聯"。

    <heading>概述</heading>
    <para>
    如果你想要對郵件施以數位簽章或者讓他人能夠寄給你加密的郵件，
    那你必須要先擁有屬於自己的公開/私密PGP金鑰對。
    </para>
    <heading>你的公開金鑰</heading>
    <para>
    你的公開金鑰可以寄給那些，你希望對方會寄發加密郵件給你的人。
    加密後的郵件只有你能解密(使用你的私密金鑰)。
    另外，你的公開金鑰可以寄給任何一位，你曾寄發給他數位簽章郵件的人 -
    因為數位簽章的驗證需要你的公開金鑰。
    </para>
    <heading>你的私密金鑰</heading>
    <para>
    你的私密金鑰被用來，解密所有以你公開金鑰加密的郵件。
    另外，如果你想要對寄發的郵件施以數位簽章，這也需要你的私密金鑰。
    你的私密金鑰將被當初金鑰建立時所產生的一組密碼所保護。
    因此當有任何需要你的私密金鑰場合時，
    網路郵局將會提示你輸入密碼。
    你只需要在每個登入期間輸入你的密碼即可 -
    網路郵局將會自動儲存你的密碼直到你登出為止
    (所以當不使用網路郵局的時候，記得要確實登出哦！)

    <para>
    PGP 是一種用於通訊以及資料的加密工具，特別是用於電子郵件。 
    PGP 可用於資料的加密、建立數位簽章。 網路郵局使用 GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard)
    以提供上述的服務。
    S/MIME 是另一種私密/公開金鑰對系統。該系統提供諸如：數位簽章，郵件加密，以及
    在開放共用上提供竄改偵測的技術。 S/MIME 可以提供郵件加密的功能，加密後的郵
    件只有寄送者及收件者可以解密。S/MIME 還可以經由數位簽章來辨識寄送者的郵件。
    加密與數位簽章一起使用更可以提供竄改偵測的功能，好讓所有收件對象判定郵件在
    寄發後是否曾被竄改。

    <para>
    S/MIME is a private/public key pair system which provides digital signatures, message privacy, and tamper detection in a open, interoperable way. S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode. It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature. Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.

S/MIME can provide message privacy by encrypting messages that only the sender and the intended recipients can decode. It allows you to identify the sender of a message via a digital signature. Together, this encryption and digital signing help provide tamper detection, allowing recipients to determine whether a message was altered after it was sent.

    在網路上有一些郵件是以一種所謂的 "multipart/alternative" 型態被傳送，

    只不過是以不同的格式儲存。
    電子郵件閱讀軟體遇到這種類型郵件的處理方式是，在瀏覽器中以內文直接顯示
    最後一個組成。至於郵件中其餘的組成，則並列顯示在 "此郵件的其他格式" 下
    方，供個別檢視或下載。
    請謹記在心，這些組成有著 "相同" 的內容 - 只是格式不同而已。
