    Sua chave pública deve estar disponível para qualquer pessoa que você quer que seja apto a enviá-lo mensagens criptografadas que somente VOCÊ pode descriptografar (usando sua chave privada).

Assim, para executar qualquer atividade que requeira sua chave privada, o IMP lhe solicitará sua senha.

    S/MIME é um sistema de chaves privada/pública que oferece assinaturas digitais, privacidade em mensagens, e detecção de alterações não autorizadas de forma aberta e interoperável. S/MIME pode oferecer privacidade de mensagens criptografando-as de forma que somente o remetente e os destinatários legítimos possam decodificá-las. Ele permite você identificar o remetente de uma mensagem através de sua assinatura digital. Juntas, a criptografia e a assinatura digital ajudam a oferecer deteccção de alterações não autorizadas, permitindo os destinatários determinarem se a mensagem foi alterada após ser enviada.

    <heading>Importar Certificados Pessoais</heading>
    <para>
    Importa certificados pessoais de um arquivo em formato PKCS #12. PKCS #12 é um arquivo geralmente gerado quando se exporta uma chave a partir de um navegador (ex.: Internet Explorer, Firefox) ou a partir de um certificado armazenado e mantido pelo Sistema Operacional (ex.: Windows XP). Se suas chaves forem válidas elas serão inseridas em suas preferências e a janela se fechará; se não forem válidas, uma mensagem de erro será retornada explicando o porquê.
